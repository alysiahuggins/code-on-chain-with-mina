# Code On Chain with Mina
Built as part of the Zk App Builders Program. 


#CodeOnChain
Learn mina blockchain development by building tiny apps that teach you key concepts. 
The user has to answer quizzes which are verified by a smart contract. 
At the end of each module, the users are expected to deploy a smart contract that demonstrates the concepts that they have learnt. 
CodeOnChain's mina smart contract tests their smart contract by interacting with methods to see if the desired outcome is achieved and if possible, also verifies key lines of code.
