# Code On Chain with Mina
Built as part of the Zk App Builders Program. 


## CodeOnChain
Learn mina blockchain development by building tiny apps that teach you key concepts. 
The user has to answer quizzes which are verified by a smart contract. 
At the end of each module, the users are expected to deploy a smart contract that demonstrates the concepts that they have learnt. 
CodeOnChain's mina smart contract tests their smart contract by interacting with methods to see if the desired outcome is achieved and if possible, also verifies key lines of code. 

### Steps to Building this App
- Create curriculum
- Define Modules
- Implement Modules

### Proposed Modules
- Mina Theory
- ZK Theory
- zkApp Theory
- Mina vs Ethereum 
- zkApp Deployment & State Management
- zkApp Example Apps

### Ideas About Implementaiton 
Think of it like a Mina Developer Roadmap. During each stage, you learn, answer quizzes and the boss stage is sending your smart contract to be verified by the Mina app. A high score is recorded, the more you retry each stage, the lower your score.  

### Questions for Mina Team
- The user can only progress if they get all questions correct in each module. Should the quiz responses be stored as state variables and verified by smart contracts?
Or is it ok to be stored offchain and verified on the client?
